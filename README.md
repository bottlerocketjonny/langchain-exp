#### Getting started

1. Create a .env file at the project root. This should have the variables 'OPENAI_API_KEY' and 'HF_API_KEY' for Open AI and HuggingFace.
2. Run `mvn install`
3. Run `mvn spring-boot:run`

#### Usage

- Please see the Swagger documentation for info on the API endpoints.
- If you want to use the 'chat-with-docs' endpoint, then you will need to save a .txt file in the 'src/main/resources/' directory.
